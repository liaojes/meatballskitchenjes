Want to contact me? Well I don’t blame you, I’d quite like to get in touch with myself as well. Ahaha.

Poor psychiatry related jokes aside – my contact address is below.

# [liao.jes@gmail.com] [email]

## What can I contact you about?
Whatever you want really, I’ll gladly hear questions about coding, my taste in biscuits, or even I’ll gladly hear how your day has gone. Similarly if you want to call me sanctimonious, odorous, and contemptible then I’ll even read that. It might even make for a good blog entry someday.

### It’s that easy to get your email address?
Sure, I’ve got pretty good spam filtering, and it’s not like that’s my main address, so I could conceivably change the email address if everything kicks off with spambots. Why make it difficult for people to get in touch?
